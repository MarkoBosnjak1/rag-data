# Frontend Technologies

Our frontend architecture centers on Vue.js 3 with the Composition API, providing a reactive and modular approach to UI development. We've embraced Nuxt.js for its universal rendering capabilities, which delivers optimal performance for both initial page loads and subsequent client-side navigation. For state management, we utilize Pinia, the official Vue recommendation that offers a simpler and more intuitive alternative to Vuex with TypeScript support. Our component design system is built on Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens, allowing for rapid UI development while maintaining visual consistency across applications. For complex form handling, we leverage FormKit to reduce boilerplate and improve validation workflows. Our testing strategy combines Vitest for unit testing with Cypress for end-to-end scenarios, achieving over 85% code coverage. For component documentation and visual testing, we use Histoire, which provides a lightweight alternative to Storybook specifically optimized for Vue components. We've implemented Vite as our build tool, dramatically improving development server startup times and hot module replacement speed. For animation and transitions, we use GSAP and Vue's built-in transition system. Our accessibility compliance is maintained through axe-core integration and regular manual audits with screen readers. We've recently adopted Module Federation to share components across multiple applications while maintaining independent deployment cycles, significantly reducing duplication and ensuring consistency in our user experience.

# Backend Architecture

Our backend infrastructure is built on a serverless-first architecture using AWS Lambda with the Serverless Framework for deployment and management. For API development, we use FastAPI (Python) for its performance, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and strong typing through Pydantic models. Our event-driven components leverage AWS EventBridge for service-to-service communication, enabling loose coupling between microservices. For data persistence, we employ a polyglot approach with Aurora PostgreSQL for transactional data, DynamoDB for high-throughput use cases, and ElastiCache Redis for caching and session management. Our GraphQL API layer is implemented with Strawberry GraphQL, providing code-first schema definition with Python type hints. For background processing and scheduled tasks, we use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows across multiple services. Our logging infrastructure centralizes logs in CloudWatch with structured JSON formatting and custom metric extraction. For authentication and authorization, we've implemented Amazon Cognito with custom triggers for specialized authentication flows, integrated with our enterprise SSO provider. API security is enforced through AWS WAF with custom rule sets and rate limiting. We've built a comprehensive observability stack using AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing, combined with custom instrumentation for business-level metrics. Our service mesh implementation uses AWS App Mesh to manage service-to-service communication with circuit breaking, retries, and traffic splitting capabilities.

# DevOps and Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a combination of Terraform for resource provisioning and Pulumi for application infrastructure, giving us the benefits of infrastructure-as-code with the flexibility of a programming language for complex logic. We've implemented a multi-region strategy for critical services to ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. Our containerization approach uses Docker with distroless base images to minimize attack surface, orchestrated by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Autopilot for reduced operational overhead. For CI/CD, we've built pipelines using GitLab CI with environment-specific workflows and approval gates for production deployments. Our release strategy follows trunk-based development with feature flags managed through ConfigCat. For secrets management, we use Google Secret Manager with automatic rotation policies. Our monitoring stack combines Google Cloud Monitoring with Grafana Cloud for visualization and alerting, supplemented by OpenTelemetry for application instrumentation. We've implemented SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for all critical services with error budgets that inform our development priorities. For cost management, we use FinOps practices with Kubecost for Kubernetes spending analysis and custom dashboards for resource optimization. Our infrastructure security includes Binary Authorization for container verification, VPC Service Controls for network isolation, and regular security scanning with Trivy. We've recently adopted Terraform Cloud for state management and collaborative infrastructure development, significantly improving our team's ability to work on infrastructure changes in parallel.

# Quality Assurance Processes

Our quality engineering approach is built around continuous testing principles, with quality verification integrated throughout the development lifecycle. We practice test-driven development (TDD) for core business logic, supplemented by behavior-driven development (BDD) using Behave for Python services and Cucumber.js for JavaScript components. Our automated testing pyramid includes unit tests, contract tests with Pact for service boundaries, and end-to-end tests using Playwright for cross-browser verification. Performance testing is conducted using Locust for API load testing and WebPageTest for frontend performance analysis, with performance budgets enforced in our CI pipeline. We've implemented visual regression testing using Applitools Eyes, which uses AI to detect meaningful visual changes while ignoring expected variations. Our accessibility testing combines automated scans using pa11y with manual testing by specialists using assistive technologies. For mobile testing, we maintain a device lab with the most common device/OS combinations, supplemented by BrowserStack for extended coverage. Security testing includes regular SAST scans with Semgrep, dependency vulnerability scanning with Snyk, and quarterly penetration testing by external specialists. We've established a robust bug triage process with clear severity definitions and automated routing to appropriate teams. Our exploratory testing follows session-based test management (SBTM) principles, with structured charters and debriefs. We track quality metrics including defect escape rate, test automation coverage, and mean time to detection, using these insights to continuously refine our testing strategy.

# Data Engineering and Analytics

Our data platform is built on Google Cloud's data services, with BigQuery as our central data warehouse providing petabyte-scale analytics capabilities with separation of storage and compute. For data integration, we use Airbyte to manage our ELT pipelines, enabling rapid connector development and simplified maintenance. Our data transformation layer is implemented with dbt, providing version-controlled, tested data models with clear lineage documentation. For stream processing, we've deployed Apache Beam running on Dataflow, handling both batch and streaming workloads with a unified programming model. Our data lake architecture follows the lakehouse paradigm using Delta Lake on Google Cloud Storage, providing ACID transactions and schema enforcement on our object storage. For data quality, we've implemented Great Expectations with automated profiling and validation as part of our data pipelines. Our data catalog and discovery layer uses DataHub, providing a comprehensive inventory of data assets with ownership, lineage, and quality metrics. For business intelligence, we've standardized on Looker, with LookML models version-controlled alongside our dbt transformations. Our experimentation platform uses a custom-built solution with Bayesian statistical methods for more accurate analysis of experiment results. For machine learning operations, we use Vertex AI with custom containers for training and serving, integrated with our CI/CD pipelines for model deployment. We've implemented data governance through BigQuery column-level access controls and data classification tags, with automated PII detection and masking for sensitive information.

# Security and Compliance Framework

Our security architecture follows a zero-trust model, operating on the principle that no user or system is inherently trusted, regardless of location or network. We've implemented FIDO2-compliant passwordless authentication using WebAuthn across our applications, significantly reducing the risk of credential-based attacks. For authorization, we use Open Policy Agent (OPA) with centrally managed policies that enforce fine-grained access controls consistently across services. Our container security strategy includes Sysdig Secure for runtime protection and vulnerability management, with automatic blocking of high-risk activities. For code security, we've integrated GitHub Advanced Security with CodeQL for semantic code analysis, identifying complex security vulnerabilities beyond what traditional SAST tools can detect. Our secrets management relies on HashiCorp Vault with dynamic secrets generation and automatic rotation. We've implemented a comprehensive encryption strategy with envelope encryption for sensitive data and field-level encryption for PII. Our cloud security posture is managed through Wiz, providing continuous monitoring of our multi-cloud environment for misconfigurations and compliance violations. For threat detection, we use a combination of CrowdStrike for endpoint protection and Panther for cloud-native SIEM capabilities, with custom detection rules based on MITRE ATT&CK frameworks. We maintain compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001, with automated compliance checks integrated into our CI/CD pipeline. Our security incident response follows NIST guidelines with defined playbooks for common scenarios and regular tabletop exercises to test our procedures. We've recently implemented a security champions program to embed security expertise within each development team.
