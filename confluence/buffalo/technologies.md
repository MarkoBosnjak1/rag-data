# Frontend Technologies
Team Buffalo primarily focuses on backend technologies, particularly in C++ and Java, which are essential for developing automated tests for radio software. While we do not have a dedicated frontend team, we collaborate closely with other teams that handle user interfaces. Our backend services are designed to ensure that the signal processing modules function correctly across various hardware configurations. We utilize various libraries and frameworks to enhance our testing capabilities, ensuring that our software meets the highest quality standards.

# Backend Architecture
Our backend architecture is built around C++ and Java, leveraging their strengths for performance and reliability. We utilize JCAT for test automation, which allows us to create robust test cases that simulate real-world scenarios. Jenkins is employed for continuous integration and delivery, ensuring that our code is always in a deployable state. We also use Git for version control, enabling seamless collaboration among team members. This architecture supports our goal of delivering high-quality software efficiently.

# DevOps and Infrastructure
Team Buffalo follows Agile Scrum methodologies, which promote flexibility and adaptability in our development processes. Our infrastructure is designed to support continuous integration and delivery, allowing us to respond quickly to changing requirements. We utilize Jenkins for automating our build and deployment processes, ensuring that our software is tested and delivered promptly. Our team also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean and organized codebase, which is facilitated by our use of Git for version control.

# Quality Assurance Processes
Quality assurance is a cornerstone of Team Buffalo's operations. We implement rigorous testing protocols to ensure that our automated tests are reliable and effective. Our testing pyramid includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, with a focus on achieving high test coverage across all services. We utilize various testing frameworks to validate our software, ensuring that it meets the highest quality standards before deployment. Regular code reviews and retrospectives help us continuously improve our testing processes.

# Data Engineering and Analytics
While Team Buffalo primarily focuses on testing and quality assurance, we recognize the importance of data in our processes. We collaborate with data engineering teams to ensure that our tests are comprehensive and cover various scenarios. Our approach includes analyzing test results and leveraging data to identify areas for improvement. By integrating data-driven insights into our testing processes, we can enhance the reliability and performance of our automated tests.

# Security and Compliance Framework
Security is a top priority for Team Buffalo. We implement best practices to ensure that our software is secure and compliant with industry standards. Our testing processes include security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that our automated tests do not introduce security risks. We also maintain open lines of communication with other teams to ensure that security considerations are integrated into our development processes. Regular training and awareness programs help foster a culture of security mindfulness within the team.
