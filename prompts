Tech markdown
Please  technologies.md markdown file.

Products
CXP product numbers are deliverables in artifactory(binaries, source code, etc).
Create products.md markdown file.

Description(with Contacts)
Create description.md markdown file, containing general summary of the team and people/contacts.

way of working/processes
Create way of working.md markdown file.

stakeholders/customers
Stakeholders can be different teams from json data.
Create stakeholders.md markdown file.

reports(kpi/monitoring/alerts)
Create reports.md markdown file.

Each markdown should have 6 headers with text.
This should represent wiki page from some software development team in real life.
Data should be different for each time, since I want to use it for rag.
Make each heading text 150 to 250 words!
Reference to the organization data for each team and subunits with relations:
